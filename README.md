<span class="c17 c18">Pokemon Go - Rare Pokemon Sightings (SF)</span>

</div>

<span class="c20 c22 c17">1\. About</span>

<span class="c26">I</span> <span class="c26 c31">really</span><span class="c1"> wanted something that can reliably present useful spawn data so I would know where I should go instead of wasting an entire afternoon and evening wandering for these specifically rare critters without knowing where they are relatively located throughout the week, in spite of the new Nearby feature. As a Pokedex Holder at a legitimate 721 entries across several generations from Red alongside my completionist motivation over the years, being so close at finding them all [Kanto] in my favorite franchise is quite irksome to me. Especially, knowing that there are rumors of certain locations at certain times translate to there is a pattern that we could probably derive. Snorlax at Stow Lake? Really? When?</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c26">There was also a reddit thread not too long ago that pointed out the twitter @thecitypokemon by the user ‘/u/leaguesleagues’, however, I did not make the spreadsheet because of that thread. (I actually did not check /r/PokemonGoSF during that time but that user’s thread gets an honorable link in my sheets) A friend actually mentioned that there was a twitter that announced this.</span>

<span class="c14"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">1.1 Tweets</span>

<span class="c26">Everything is automated using functions. However, t</span><span class="c35 c26">here is a</span> <span class="c4 c3 c29">huge time delay</span><span class="c35 c26"> per data entry</span><span class="c1"> - refer to the twitter @thecitypokemon if you are actually searching for rare Pokemon or the "Pokemon, time, location, date" sheet to see the most recent entry (The latest tweet update cells have a delay in its update as well). Otherwise, do use these sheets to gauge a pattern approximating the spawn radius and times, especially since these rare Pokemon do not have a designated nest (Unlike Squirtles at Fort Mason) or are not commonly spawned at an area (Unlike Charmanders at Rincon Park).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c26">Yes, I am aware of duplicate tweets skewing the data, but they are not significant enough to affect most of the surface data. If necessary, one can simply omit the consecutive data manually.. I am also aware of the</span><span class="c3"> caveats</span><span class="c26">of this spreadsheet because it relies on</span> <span class="c26 c35">1\. Niantic Servers, 2\. @thecitypokemon Tweets, 3\. IFTTT servers, and 4\. Google Servers</span><span class="c1">. Hopefully this document runs for, at the least, the next 2 months (starting from August 19th).</span>

<span class="c14"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">1.2 Certain Pokemon</span>

<span class="c1">From many sources and a personal anecdote - Lapras may appear at Ocean Beach between 3pm-5pm near the Cliff House / Ocean Beach area. I personally caught a Lapras at 3:40pm at the Cliff House on a Wednesday after several rumors of Lapras’ spawning near Beach Chalet (on Aug-17-2016)] but do take note that your mileage may vary, especially if Niantic changes their spawns!</span>

<span class="c14"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">1.3 Other Cities</span>

<span class="c1">Because I’ve used simple simple functions to process each tweet into different elements/cells, it is actually possible to replicate this spreadsheet for another city, provided that every tweet follows a specific format with a location link (Preferably Google Maps or any Mapping service where you can save coordinates/locations)</span>

<span class="c14"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">1.4 Special Thanks</span>

<span class="c26">All special thanks and everyone who have contributed in some significant way are listed on the “Special Thanks” sheet.</span>

* * *

<span class="c20 c22 c17">2\. Map Links</span>

<span>Luckily these tweets have a location link for us to follow. So f</span><span class="c14">or all location links, click "Save" to each of your desired Pokemon's Google Map link. It is also recommended to look for the links in the "Sorted Data" sheet!</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">2.1 Mapping Example</span>

<span>Example of utilizing the location links which may help approximate an area of these non-specific nests for your hunt via multiple "stars" populated on your map. To remove the saved link, click on the star and click the "saved" icon.</span> <span class="c17">Remember</span><span class="c14"> to watch your surroundings when you do go to these locations and try to hunt during the daytime!</span>

</span><span class="c21">I chose 3 random locations out of several for this Pokemon but you can almost approximate the general spawn area. Do note that there may be outliers, spawn locations may change over time due to Niantic updates, and a correlation does not necessarily mean a causation.</span>

<span class="c23 c21">3D Pie Chart</span>

<span class="c26">What are some basic conclusions that we could draw from these statistics? Out of all the tweets, there is a high proportion of Aerodactyl spawns tweeted compared to the other rare Pokemon in San Francisco ever since these tweets were logged or San Francisco is the place to be if one wants to look for an Aerodactyl (after approximating the Pokemon’s general spawn radius and time range).</span><span> </span><span class="c23 c34">OR perhaps that Twitter account has a bias with [average number of Aerodactyl] Aerodactyl tweets.</span>

<span class="c1">*I do understand that all locations may change over time and a correlated pattern does not necessarily mean a fact.</span>

<span class="c17">4.2</span> <span class="c20 c24 c17">Replication</span>

<span>        </span><span class="c26">Like I have said in</span> <span class="c26 c31">1.3 Other Cities</span><span class="c26">, this type of document is perfectly replicable. Who knows, you may even make a better one than me.</span>

<span class="c14"></span>

<span class="c20 c17 c22">5\. Other Information</span>

<span class="c1">        Again, this spreadsheet relies on several services to function well. Because of that, it is best to go to the source Twitter or live map applications. Do use the document, and probable derivatives (Other similar spreadsheets), for research purposes.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c17">5</span><span class="c20 c24 c17">.1 Services</span>

<span class="c1">        Of course, the two free services that I have used are IFTTT and Google [Applications]</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">5.1.1 IFTTT</span>

<span class="c26">First off, this service is simple and popular. There is an article that compares the service IFTTT versus other similar services (Zapier/Microsoft Flow) but I am not going to discuss that here - Just a simple service that I have used for a few years.</span> <span class="c23 c34">(Especially during the Amiibo craze)</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Do note that IFTTT polls tweets about every 10 to 30 minutes. Thus the spreadsheet document also relies on whether or not there are tweets.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">I am aware of IFTTT’s 2000 row limit, my solution is to create a new spreadsheet to accommodate the new tweets collected while using an array formula to collect the new data, thus without adjusted pre-existing sheets that grabs data from the tweet data sheet (EG: Adjusted Data).</span>

<span class="c23 c34"></span>

<span class="c17">5.1.1.1</span> <span class="c20 c24 c17">My IFTTT recipe</span>

<span class="c26">IFTTT recipe - If |New Tweets by @thecitypokemon|, Then |Add row to Spreadsheet|</span>

<span class="c14"></span>

<span class="c20 c24 c17">5.1.2 Google</span>

<span class="c1">Seems like the obvious free choice. Everything is stored on Google’s cloud servers as well as having only one account as a “One Stop Shop” to access everything else just from your browser, including YouTube. Apologies if it seems like I am fawning over Google, it is just that they provide a reliable and accessible service.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c2">5.1.2.1 Google Spreadsheets</span>

<span class="c26">All the data is grabbed from a m</span><span class="c1">aster spreadsheet that I can easily edit at ease without touching the main spreadsheet using the =importrange(“dockey”,”sheet!range”). I do not have plans to release that document for viewing for obvious reasons (It’s a nasty playground with too many sheets). Do feel free to copy the data, as well as using the links.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c26">Please note: All the tweet data logged have an update delay and each tweet is processed automatically.</span>
